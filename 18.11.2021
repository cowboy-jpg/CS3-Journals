=====================================================
What did I learn today? What is the "big idea"?
Today was our first day using SQL and connecting to the database. I believe the 'big idea' lies in how this newfound information will connect to our work on the scheduling app.

What challenges did I encounter?
I was unable to access the database / directory.

How has what I've learned impacted my thinking?
I was able to see how SQL could potentially connect with the scheduling app we're creating.
